- Library structure -
This directory has the following structure:

!LibmUnit
  |
  +---!Boot
  +---!Help (this help file)
  +---!Run
  +---!Sprites
  +---a (here you'll find the GCC static linkable lib file)
  +---docs (this directory contains documentation, when available)
  +---Examples (this directory contains example source code to see how to use the lib)
  +---h (this directory contains the c header files for the lib)
  +---o (this directory contains the DDE static linkable lib file, when available)
  \---so (this directory contains the dynamic linkable lib file, when available)

- GCC -
To compile your code using the static version of the library use:

If you compile using a single gcc line:
gcc blah blah -ILibmUnit: LibmUnit:a/libmunit

If you compile using multiple gcc lines:
gcc blah blah -c -o $@.o myapp.c -ILibmUnit:
gcc blah blah -o myapp ./myapp.o LibmUnit:a/Libmunit

To compile your code using the dynamic version of the library use:
1) First copy the content of the so directory in !SharedLibs.lib.abi-2/0. To make this operation easier, you can use the !InstallSOs script inside the !LibmUnit directory.
2) To be safe reload the SOManager
3) Compile your code using:
gcc blah blah  -Wl,-s -LDSOLib:lib.abi-2/0 -ILibmUnit:

Enjoy and thanks!
